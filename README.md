## Introduction

Program that converts Aim RaceStudio Data to MoTeC i2 Pro Data.

Programmed in VS C#. 

Uses a dll to read from the file.

We invested a significant amount of effort in reverse engineering to decipher Motec's proprietary file format. This was necessary to enable the file to be both written and opened by i2 Pro. If i2 detects even a minor formatting error in the file, it will either refuse to read it or recognize it as a Standard file rather than a Pro file.

## Features

- Reading all of the data contained in an Aim File
- Converting names from Aim standart to MoTeC standard
- Fully open source
- Simple interface
- Sub-folder search: searched all sub folders for files and converts all of them
- Read data preview button before converting
- Choice between processed or raw GPS data (using Aim dll)

## Getting Started

The project build is standalone for Windows 64b. Only download the latest build and extract from zip to run the app.

## Usage

1. Run the application
2. Check sub-folder if you have multiple files to convert
3. Browse for folder or file
4. [optionnal] select output directory
5. [optionnal] Press Read data to preview the data and channel names
6. [optionnal] Add to NameConversion.txt name to be converted
7. Check Rename Channels if you want to rename the channels to those suggested
8. Check Use raw GPS data if you wish to use raw GPS data from file
9. Convert
10. Open converted file in i2 Pro

## How to run

`dotnet build Aim_2_MoTeC.sln`
`dotnet run --project Aim_2_MoTeC/Aim_2_MoTeC.csproj`
